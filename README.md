Project Steps
1. Data Loading & EDA
Imported raw CSV/Excel data using Pandas.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Generated visualizations to understand seasonal trends.

2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
Standardized data formats (dates, currency, and categorical strings).
Performed feature engineering to create new metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) or Profit Margin.

3. MySQL Analysis
Exported cleaned data to a MySQL Workbench environment.
Wrote complex SQL queries involving Joins, CTEs, and Window Functions to extract high-level business KPIs.

4. Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.
Developed an interactive multi-page dashboard.
Implemented DAX measures for dynamic filtering and time-intelligence analysis.
